React native first project. 

Welcome to my very first ever developed React Native app, it is a very simple one, related to setting goals,  the app allows people to add a goal, see their added goals, and delete any of them. 

Access to the app: https://expo.dev/@denismendoza/denis-mendoza-react-native-first?serviceType=classic&distribution=expo-go

Instructions: 

The app needs to be seen from a mobile device. 

Download Expo Go to your mobile device, Further instructions here: https://expo.dev/client.

Once step two is completed please go here https://expo.dev/@denismendoza/denis-mendoza-react-native-first?serviceType=classic&distribution=expo-go

A page will load giving you the option to “open on Expo go” or something similar. 


Structure: 

The app once loaded shows as a first page, a modal, with an image, a text input section and a button, inviting the user to add a goal. 

Once that is done, the app moves to its main page, where the user can visualize all the added goals along with a button at the top allowing them to add a new goal, once that is pressed, the modal with the image slides back into the screen. 

If the user tabs on one of the added goals, this deletes it.

If the user tryes to click on the modals Add a Goal button without inputting any text, a "Believe in you" message will auto populate, this is done to prevent empty info to be add it to the goals, along with serving as an extra motivational message.

Extra info:

For this layout to be possible: I used several components, like text, view, Button among others including having to customize the top bar using the Status Bar component , so essential information about the phone is still visible to the user. 

Special thanks to Maximilliam Schuarzmuller over at  https://youtu.be/VozPNrt-LfE, this entire project was mostly guided by his youtube tutorial  

This whole project was an awesome first experience for me and it will allow me to keep working on my skills getting better and better everyday.

Thank you for reading this, have a great day.
